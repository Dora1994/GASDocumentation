# 4.8 Gameplay Cues

## 4.8.1 Gameplay Cue Definition

`GameplayCues` (`GC`) execute non-gameplay related things like sound effects, particle effects, camera shakes, etc. `GameplayCues` are typically replicated (unless explicitly `Executed`, `Added`, or `Removed` locally) and predicted.

We trigger `GameplayCues` by sending a corresponding `GameplayTag` with the **mandatory parent name of `GameplayCue.`** and an event type (`Execute`, `Add`, or `Remove`) to the `GameplayCueManager` via the `ASC`. `GameplayCueNotify` objects and other `Actors` that implement the `IGameplayCueInterface` can subscribe to these events based on the `GameplayCue's` `GameplayTag` (`GameplayCueTag`).

**Note:** Just to reiterate, `GameplayCue` `GameplayTags` need to start with the parent `GameplayTag` of `GameplayCue`. So for example, a valid `GameplayCue` `GameplayTag` might be `GameplayCue.A.B.C`.

There are two classes of `GameplayCueNotifies`, `Static` and `Actor`. They respond to different events and different types of `GameplayEffects` can trigger them. Override the corresponding event with your logic.

| [`GameplayCueNotify_Actor`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/BlueprintAPI/GameplayCueNotify/index.html)                           | `Add` or `Remove` | `Duration` or `Infinite` | Actor `GameplayCueNotifies` spawn a new instance when `Added`. Because these are instanced, they can do actions over time until they are `Removed`. These are good for looping sounds and particle effects that will be removed when the backing `Duration` or `Infinite` `GameplayEffect` is removed or by manually calling remove. These also come with options to manage how many are allowed to be `Added` at the same time so that multiple applications of the same effect only start the sounds or particles once. |

`GameplayCueNotifies` technically can respond to any of the events but this is typically how we use them.

**Note:** When using `GameplayCueNotify_Actor`, check `Auto Destroy on Remove` otherwise subsequent calls to `Add` that `GameplayCueTag` won't work.

When using an `ASC` [Replication Mode](04-1-ability-system-component.md) other than `Full`, `Add` and `Remove` `GC` events will fire twice on Server players (listen server) - once for applying the `GE` and again from the "Minimal" `NetMultiCast` to the clients. However, `WhileActive` events will still only fire once. All events will only fire once on clients.

The Sample Project includes a `GameplayCueNotify_Actor` for stun and sprint effects. It also has a `GameplayCueNotify_Static` for the FireGun's projectile impact. These `GCs` can be optimized further by [triggering them locally](#concepts-gc-local) instead of replicating them through a `GE`. I opted for showing the beginner way of using them in the Sample Project.

## 4.8.2 Triggering Gameplay Cues

From inside of a `GameplayEffect` when it is successfully applied (not blocked by tags or immunity), fill in the `GameplayTags` of all the `GameplayCues` that should be triggered.

`UGameplayAbility` offers Blueprint nodes to `Execute`, `Add`, or `Remove` `GameplayCues`.

![GameplayCue Triggered from a GameplayAbility](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/gcfromga.png)

In C++, you can call functions directly on the `ASC` (or expose them to Blueprint in your `ASC` subclass):

```c++
/** GameplayCues can also come on their own. These take an optional effect context to pass through hit result, etc */
void ExecuteGameplayCue(const FGameplayTag GameplayCueTag, FGameplayEffectContextHandle EffectContext = FGameplayEffectContextHandle());
void ExecuteGameplayCue(const FGameplayTag GameplayCueTag, const FGameplayCueParameters& GameplayCueParameters);

/** Add a persistent gameplay cue */
void AddGameplayCue(const FGameplayTag GameplayCueTag, FGameplayEffectContextHandle EffectContext = FGameplayEffectContextHandle());
void AddGameplayCue(const FGameplayTag GameplayCueTag, const FGameplayCueParameters& GameplayCueParameters);

/** Remove a persistent gameplay cue */
void RemoveGameplayCue(const FGameplayTag GameplayCueTag);
	
/** Removes any GameplayCue added on its own, i.e. not as part of a GameplayEffect. */
void RemoveAllGameplayCues();
```
