# 4.6 Gameplay Abilities

## 4.6.1 Gameplay Ability Definition

[`GameplayAbilities`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/Abilities/UGameplayAbility/index.html) (`GA`) are any actions or skills that an `Actor` can do in the game. More than one `GameplayAbility` can be active at one time for example sprinting and shooting a gun. These can be made in Blueprint or C++.

Examples of `GameplayAbilities`:
* Jumping
* Sprinting
* Shooting a gun
* Passively blocking an attack every X number of seconds
* Using a potion
* Opening a door
* Collecting a resource
* Constructing a building

Things that should not be implemented with `GameplayAbilities`:
* Basic movement input
* Some interactions with UIs - Don't use a `GameplayAbility` to purchase an item from a store.

These are not rules, just my recommendations. Your design and implementations may vary.

`GameplayAbilities` come with default functionality to have a level to modify the amount of change to attributes or to change the `GameplayAbility's` functionality.

`GameplayAbilities` run on the owning client and/or the server depending on the [Net Execution Policy](#concepts-ga-net) but not simulated proxies. The `Net Execution Policy` determines if a `GameplayAbility` will be locally [predicted](04-10-prediction.md). They include default behavior for [optional cost and cooldown `GameplayEffects`](#concepts-ga-commit). `GameplayAbilities` use [AbilityTasks](04-7-ability-tasks.md) for actions that happen over time like waiting for an event, waiting for an attribute change, waiting for players to choose a target, or moving a `Character` with `Root Motion Source`. **Simulated clients will not run `GameplayAbilities`**. Instead, when the server runs the ability, anything that visually needs to play on the simulated proxies (like animation montages) will be replicated or RPC'd through `AbilityTasks` or [GameplayCues](04-8-gameplay-cues.md) for cosmetic things like sounds and particles.

All `GameplayAbilities` will have their `ActivateAbility()` function overriden with your gameplay logic. Additional logic can be added to `EndAbility()` that runs when the `GameplayAbility` completes or is canceled.

Complex abilities can be implemented using multiple `GameplayAbilities` that interact (activate, cancel, etc) with each other.

### 4.6.1.1 Replication Policy

Don't use this option. The name is misleading and you don't need it. [GameplayAbilitySpecs](#concepts-ga-spec) are replicated from the server to the owning client by default. As mentioned above, **`GameplayAbilities` don't run on simulated proxies**. They use `AbilityTasks` and `GameplayCues` to replicate or RPC visual changes to the simulated proxies. Dave Ratti from Epic has stated his desire to [remove this option in the future](https://epicgames.ent.box.com/s/m1egifkxv3he3u3xezb9hzbgroxyhx89).

### 4.6.1.2 Server Respects Remote Ability Cancellation

This option causes trouble more often than not. It means if the client's `GameplayAbility` ends either due to cancellation or natural completion, it will force the server's version to end whether it completed or not. The latter issue is the important one, especially for locally predicted `GameplayAbilities` used by players with high latencies. Generally you will want to disable this option.

### 4.6.1.3 Replicate Input Directly

Setting this option will always replicate input press and release events to the server. Epic recommends not using this and instead relying on the `Generic Replicated Events` that are built into the existing input related [AbilityTasks](04-7-ability-tasks.md) if you have your [input bound to your `ASC`](#concepts-ga-input).

Epic's comment:
```c++
/** Direct Input state replication. These will be called if bReplicateInputDirectly is true on the ability and is generally not a good thing to use. (Instead, prefer to use Generic Replicated Events). */
```
