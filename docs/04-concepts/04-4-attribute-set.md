# 4.4 Attribute Set

## 4.4.1 Attribute Set Definition

The `AttributeSet` defines, holds, and manages changes to `Attributes`. Developers should subclass from [`UAttributeSet`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/UAttributeSet/index.html). Creating an `AttributeSet` in an `OwnerActor's` constructor automatically registers it with its `ASC`. **This must be done in C++**.

## 4.4.2 Attribute Set Design

An `ASC` may have one or many `AttributeSets`. AttributeSets have negligible memory overhead so how many `AttributeSets` to use is an organizational decision left up to the developer.

It is acceptable to have one large monolithic `AttributeSet` shared by every `Actor` in your game and only use attributes if needed while ignoring unused attributes.

Alternatively, you may choose to have more than one `AttributeSet` representing groupings of `Attributes` that you selectively add to your `Actors` as needed. For example, you could have an `AttributeSet` for health related `Attributes`, an `AttributeSet` for mana related `Attributes`, and so on. In a MOBA game, heroes might need mana but minions might not. Therefore the heroes would get the mana `AttributeSet` and minions would not.

Additionally, `AttributeSets` can be subclassed as another means of selectively choosing which `Attributes` an `Actor` has. `Attributes` are internally referred to as `AttributeSetClassName.AttributeName`. When you subclass an `AttributeSet`, all of the `Attributes` from the parent class will still have the parent class's name as the prefix.

While you can have more than one `AttributeSet`, you should not have more than one `AttributeSet` of the same class on an `ASC`. If you have more than one `AttributeSet` from the same class, it won't know which `AttributeSet` to use and will just pick one.

### 4.4.2.1 Subcomponents with Individual Attributes

In the scenario where you have multiple damageable components on a `Pawn` like individually damageable armor pieces, I recommend that if you know the maximum number of damageable components that a `Pawn` could have to make that many health `Attributes` on one `AttributeSet` - DamageableCompHealth0, DamageableCompHealth1, etc. to represent logical 'slots' for those damageable components. In your damageable component class instance, assign the slot number `Attribute` that can be read by `GameplayAbilities` or [Executions](04-5-gameplay-effects.md) to know which `Attribute` to apply damage to. `Pawns` that have less than the maximum number or zero of damageable components are fine. Just because a `AttributeSet` has an `Attribute`, doesn't mean that you have to use it. Unused `Attributes` take up trivial amount of memory.

If your subcomponents need many `Attributes` each, there's potentially an unbounded number of subcomponents, the subcomponents can detach and be used by other players (e.g. weapons), or for any other reason this approach doesn't work for you, I'd recommend switching away from `Attributes` and instead store plain old floats on the components. See [Item Attributes](#concepts-as-design-itemattributes).

### 4.4.2.2 Adding and Removing AttributeSets at Runtime

`AttributeSets` can be added and removed from an `ASC` at runtime; however, removing `AttributeSets` can be dangerous. For example, if an `AttributeSet` is removed on a client before the server and an `Attribute` value change is replicated to client, the `Attribute` won't find its `AttributeSet` and crash the game.

On weapon add to inventory:
```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->GetSpawnedAttributes_Mutable().AddUnique(WeaponAttributeSetPointer);
AbilitySystemComponent->ForceReplication();
```

On weapon remove from inventory:
```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->GetSpawnedAttributes_Mutable().Remove(WeaponAttributeSetPointer);
AbilitySystemComponent->ForceReplication();
```

### 4.4.2.3 Item Attributes (Weapon Ammo)

There's a few ways to implement equippable items with `Attributes` (weapon ammo, armor durability, etc). All of these approaches store values directly on the item. This is necessary for items that can be equipped by more than one player over its lifetime.

> 1. Use plain floats on the item (**Recommended**)
> 1. Separate `AttributeSet` on the item
> 1. Separate `ASC` on the item
