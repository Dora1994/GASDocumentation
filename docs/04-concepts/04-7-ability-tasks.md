# 4.7 Ability Tasks

## 4.7.1 Ability Task Definition

`GameplayAbilities` only execute in one frame. This does not allow for much flexibility on its own. To do actions that happen over time or require responding to delegates fired at some point later in time we use latent actions called `AbilityTasks`.

GAS comes with many `AbilityTasks` out of the box:
* Tasks for moving Characters with `RootMotionSource`
* A task for playing animation montages
* Tasks for responding to `Attribute` changes
* Tasks for responding to `GameplayEffect` changes
* Tasks for responding to player input
* and more

The `UAbilityTask` constructor enforces a hardcoded game-wide maximum of 1000 concurrent `AbilityTasks` running at the same time. Keep this in mind when designing `GameplayAbilities` for games that can have hundreds of characters in the world at the same time like RTS games.

## 4.7.2 Custom Ability Tasks

Often you will be creating your own custom `AbilityTasks` (in C++). The Sample Project comes with two custom `AbilityTasks`:
1. `PlayMontageAndWaitForEvent` is a combination of the default `PlayMontageAndWait` and `WaitGameplayEvent` `AbilityTasks`. This allows animation montages to send gameplay events from `AnimNotifies` back to the `GameplayAbility` that started them. Use this to trigger actions at specific times during animation montages.
1. `WaitReceiveDamage` listens for the `OwnerActor` to receive damage. The passive armor stacks `GameplayAbility` removes a stack of armor when the hero receives an instance of damage.

`AbilityTasks` are composed of:
* A static function that creates new instances of the `AbilityTask`
* Delegates that are broadcasted on when the `AbilityTask` completes its purpose
* An `Activate()` function to start its main job, bind to external delegates, etc.
* An `OnDestroy()` function for cleanup, including external delegates that it bound to
* Callback functions for any external delegates that it bound to
* Member variables and any internal helper functions

**Note:** `AbilityTasks` can only declare one type of output delegate. All of your output delegates must be of this type, regardless if they use the parameters or not. Pass default values for unused delegate parameters.

`AbilityTasks` only run on the Client or Server that is running the owning `GameplayAbility`; however, `AbilityTasks` can be set to run on simulated clients by setting `bSimulatedTask = true;` in the `AbilityTask` constructor, overriding `virtual void InitSimulatedTask(UGameplayTasksComponent& InGameplayTasksComponent);`, and setting any member variables to be replicated. This is only useful in rare situations like movement `AbilityTasks` where you don't want to replicate every movement change but instead simulate the entire movement `AbilityTask`. All of the `RootMotionSource` `AbilityTasks` do this. See `AbilityTask_MoveToLocation.h/.cpp` as an example.

`AbilityTasks` can `Tick` if you set `bTickingTask = true;` in the `AbilityTask` constructor and override `virtual void TickTask(float DeltaTime);`. This is useful when you need to lerp values smoothly across frames. See `AbilityTask_MoveToLocation.h/.cpp` as an example.

## 4.7.3 Using Ability Tasks

To create and activate an `AbilityTask` in C++ (From `GDGA_FireGun.cpp`):
```c++
UGDAT_PlayMontageAndWaitForEvent* Task = UGDAT_PlayMontageAndWaitForEvent::PlayMontageAndWaitForEvent(this, NAME_None, MontageToPlay, FGameplayTagContainer(), 1.0f, NAME_None, false, 1.0f);
Task->OnBlendOut.AddDynamic(this, &UGDGA_FireGun::OnCompleted);
Task->OnCompleted.AddDynamic(this, &UGDGA_FireGun::OnCompleted);
Task->OnInterrupted.AddDynamic(this, &UGDGA_FireGun::OnCancelled);
Task->OnCancelled.AddDynamic(this, &UGDGA_FireGun::OnCancelled);
Task->EventReceived.AddDynamic(this, &UGDGA_FireGun::EventReceived);
Task->ReadyForActivation();
```

## 4.7.4 Root Motion Source Ability Tasks

`AbilityTasks` that use `RootMotionSource` for movement are special. They can be locally predicted and will automatically handle rollback if the prediction fails. The Sample Project uses `AbilityTask_MoveToLocation` for the dash ability.
